### Journal Buddy
Consistent self-reflection and positive thinking have a huge impact on happiness. Journal Buddy makes self-reflection and positive thinking effortless.

## App Features
Journal Buddy is an interactive, full-stack web application built using ReactJS for frontend and Firebase for backend. 

The app uses a Dialogflow chatbot to provide users with journaling ideas.

After signing up, users are provided five minutes to type in a journal entry. The entry is then archived and, overtime, the user will be able to access their collection of entries.
